# Face-Recognition
A simple face recognition script that identifies and classifies all faces in an image.

You can watch this video to see how the code works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5xqcGk6LEc

# How to Run
- Install all of the packages listed in requirements.txt. 
- Place an image inside of the root direcotry called "test.png". This will be the file that faces will be identified in. 
- Place all of the faces that you wish to identify inside the folder "faces", rename them to be "face name".jpg. This folder contains all of the known faces and will be how the program recognizes people. 
- Finallly run the "face_rec.py" script.
